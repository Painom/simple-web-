                        The moment that Ma'am Loida is super proud of is when she passed the thesis<br>
                        and finished her studies. She didn't have a hard time because she got hired instantly<br>
                        in STI Meycauayan. This is also her first job and she is still serving as the School<br>
                        Administrator.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <h1>Ma'am Loida's advice and tips for upcoming STI'ers</h1>   
                        First of all, study hard because we are here at school to study and to learn. Second,<br>
                        just enjoy your college life. Because once you finish college and start working. You will miss your college life, as long as there are times when the things<br>
                        the professors ask you to do are very challenging. Just enjoy it because that's part of being a student.That's where you learn, that's where you start.<br>
                        So if you gave up here at school, what's more in reality the days you worked. It seems that school is just like your stepping stone, but when you are there<br>
                        in the real world. It seems like the real thing is there, so we should improve it now. You should learn patience especially if you are already working on a long thesis and then always obey your parents and then choose a passion that will take you up not down.
